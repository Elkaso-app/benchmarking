feedbacks :
change the big title of second ui to kaso saving potential
widget of save value to "value_of_dirham aed - then the subtitle here that in next line on right now"

in charts:
change the lines to candles start the candle with kaso_price_of_item and the and end of this candle your_price_of_item and color of this candle always red because we always offer better pricing
and ofcorse this items should not connected with each other

after charts there are top 3 items that top ..
multiply by repeated item by (random number between(7 ~ 13)) in backend and ofcorse the total saving will effected because of that ....
but flag in backend (demo=true) when we make it false will will not multiple any fake thing

in front make the top 3 time name blur just keep the prices and in price section if those top 3 remove "%" and change it with subtract "-" show saving cost base of subtract ....
